# portfolio
A curated collection of projects where I’ve explored everything from classic algorithms to modern software engineering. Each project reflects my curiosity, problem-solving process, and the joy I find in turning ideas into working code. This space is both a portfolio and a sandbox, showcasing what I’ve built and what I am learning next.
